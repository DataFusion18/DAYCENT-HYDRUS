CMIX - rate of mixing of surface SOM2C and soil SOM2C for grass/crop system, this value will also be used when running a savanna 
DDBASE - number of degree days required to trigger a senescence event for a perennial (FRTCINDX = 3), maturity for a non-grain filling annual (FRTCINDX = 4), or to anthesis for a grain filling annual(FRTCINDX = 5 or 6)
BASETEMP - base temperature for crop growth, growing degree days will accumulate only on days when the average temperature is greater than the base temperature for the crop (degrees C) 
MNDDHRV  - minimum number of degree days from anthesis to harvest for grain filling annuals (FRTCINDX = 5 or 6)

               decomposition)
PCEMIC1(1,3) - maximum C/E ratio for surface microbial pool
PCEMIC1(2,3) - minimum C/E ratio for surface microbial pool

PCEMIC2(2,3) - minimum C/E ratio for surface intermediate pool
PCEMIC2(3,3) - minimum E content of decomposing aboveground material above which the C/E ratio of the surface intermediate pool equals PCEMIC(2,*)
VARAT21(1,3) - maximum C/E ratio for material entering surface som2
VARAT21(2,3) - minimum C/E ratio for material entering surface som2
VARAT21(2,3) - amount of E present when minimum ratio applies
VARAT22(1,3) - maximum C/E ratio for material entering soil som2
